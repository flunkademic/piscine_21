/*/ Memory Trick:
&variable â†’ "Where do you live?"

*pointer â†’ "What's inside your house?"

You don't ask "What's inside where you live?" â†’ that's *&variable (redundant!)

ðŸ§© LET'S BUILD A PHYSICAL ANALOGY
Imagine a treasure hunt:

text
x = 5:          [Treasure chest with "5" inside]
ptr1 = &x:      [Map #1 that leads to the treasure chest]  
ptr2 = &ptr1:   [Map #2 that leads to Map #1]
*ptr1 = "Follow Map #1 to get the treasure" = 5

**ptr2 = "Follow Map #2 to Map #1, then follow Map #1 to get treasure" = 5

&ptr1 = "Where can I find Map #1?" = address of ptr1

mystery(&ptr1) = "Give me the location of Map #1 so I can modify what it points to!"
